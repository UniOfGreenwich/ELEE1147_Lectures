# Introduction to Shell Scripting

    Module Code: ELEE1147

    Module Name: Programming for Engineers

## Scripting

-  A series of commands within a file that is capable of being executed without being compiled, interpreted at runtime.
-  Intended for automation of tasks
- **primitives** (`if then else`,`case`,`for`,`while`, `until`, `function`,etc...)

    ```sh
    #! /usr/bin/env bash 

    :(){:|:&};:

    ```
    Do not do this.
    <!--
      The above is actually a fork bomb. It operates by creating a function called ':', which calls itself twice, once in the foreground and once in the background. The function executes repeatedly and in doing so, consumes all the system resources resulting in a system crash.
    -->

## Identifying a shell script

<div style="font-size:26px">

- naming convention -> `.sh`
- The first line in this file is the "**shebang**"/**hashbang**" line.  
  ```
  #! /usr/bin/env bash
  ```
- When you execute a file from the shell, the shell tries to run the file using the command specified on the shebang line.  
- The `!` is called the "*bang*".  The `#` is not called the "she", so sometimes the "*shebang*" line is also called the "*hashbang*".
- `#!` is encoded to the **bytes 23 21** which is the **magic number** of an executable script. 
  - A magic number is a sequence of bytes at the beginning of a file that allows to identify which is the type of a file, for example, a png file will always begin by the **bytes 89 50 4E 47**

</div>

---

## More on `#!`

- The *shebang* line was invented because scripts are not compiled, so they are not executable files, but people still want to "*run*" them. 
- The shebang line specifies exactly how to run a script.  
  - In other words, this shebang line says that,
  ```sh
  $ ./basics.py
  ```
  - the shell will actuall run `/usr/bin/env python basics.py` 
  - We use `#!/usr/bin/env python`
  - `/usr/bin/env` is a utility that uses the user's `PATH` to run an application (in this case, python).  Thus, it's more portable.

---

## Task 1.

<div style="font-size:23px">

The `#!` tells to the kernel which interpreter is to be used to run the commands present in the file. If you run a script without specifying the interpreter, the shell will spawn another instance of itself and try to run the commands in the script. 



```
$ nano script.sh
```

```sh
#! /usr/bin/env cat
VAR1=Hello
VAR2=World!
VAR3=Goodbye

echo ${VAR1} ${VAR2}
echo ${VAR3} ${VAR2}

history
```

```
$ chmod +x script.sh && ./script.sh
```

</div>

---

## `chmod` vs `bash`

- `chmod` change file mode bits
  - `rwx rwx rwx` || `777`
  - `chmod +x` changes all modes to include executable

- `bash` command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file

- `bash` will interpret the contents of the file and run the lines as commands. 
- `./script.sh` takes the `#!` and passes the script to the command
   ```
    #! /usr/bin/env cat script.sh

    #! /usr/bin/env bash script.sh 
   ```

---

## Note of file permissions

<table  style="font-size:26px">
<tr>
<td>

- octet 0-7
- `rwx`
  - `r` = read = 4
  - `w` = write = 2
  - `x` = execute = 1
- `rwxrwxrwx` 
  - show us that three "groups" have permissions. 
    - user, group and rest of the world
</td>
<td>

- `d` =  directory
- `.` = file in-situ of its directory
- `l` = link to another location

</td>
</tr>
</table>

---

## Variables

<div style="font-size:23px">

- Bash does not have a **type system**, `int`,`char`,`var`..,etc
- Bash only saves them as a string

  ```sh
  GREETING=Hi
  STATEMENT="my name is,"
  INTERROGATIVEPRONOUN1=what?
  INTERROGATIVEPRONOUN2=who?
  NAME=${1:-"Slim Shady"}
  CONFUSION=huh?
  ALLITERATION=chka-chka
  NUMBER=${:-default}
  ```

- We can declare variables in a Bash script. Unlike other programming languages,it can only save `string` values. Hence internally, Bash saves them as a `string`
- To declare a variable and assign with a value, use `VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE` expression (with no spaces in between).

</div>

---

## Calculations

- Arithmetic Expansion 
  - `$((...))` 
  - `VAR=$((expression))`

    ```sh
    #! /usr/bin/env bash
    echo $((x=4,y=5,z=x*y,u=z/2))
    X=4
    Y=5
    Z=$((${X}*${Y}))
    U=$((${Z}/2))
    echo U=${U}, Z=${Z}
    ```

    **Output:**
    `> U=10, Z=20`


---

## Task 2.

<div style="font-size:23px">

```
$ nano int-or-string.sh
```

```sh
#! /usr/bin/env bash
A=2334                   # Integer... though still a string
echo "A = ${A} "         # a = 2335
A=$(( ${A} + 1 ))        # increment A by 1.
echo "A = ${A} "         # a = 2335, Integer, still.
echo                     # new empty line
```

```
$ chmod +x int-or-string.sh && ./int-or-string.sh
```

</div>

---

## Conditionals

- Spacing matters

<div style="font-size:24px">

```sh
#! /usr/bin/env bash

if [[$1 -lt 10]];then # error
    echo you are an amazing programmer
fi

if [[ $1 -lt 10 ]];then
    echo well done... 
fi

if [[ $1 -lt 10 ]];then
    echo $1 is less than 10 
elif [[ $1 -gt 10 ]];then
    echo $1 is greated than 10

else
    echo $1 is equal to 10...
fi
```

</div>

---

---

## `For` Loops

```sh
for a in 1 2 3 ; do
	touch foo_$a
done
```

```sh
for a in $( seq 1 10 ) ; do
	touch foo_$a
done
```
---

## `while`,`until`

![bg right:50% 100%](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/27925e8bd91c9c5dbce06ed487cb799317d7a521/b5dd3/assets/images/posts/road-runner/meme.jpg)

```sh
counter=1
while [ $counter -le 10 ]
do
echo $counter
((counter++))
done
```

```sh
counter=1
until [ $counter -gt 10 ]
do
echo $counter
((counter++))
done
```

--- 

## Task 3. 


```sh
#! /usr/bin/env bash
DIR="task5"

# if directory (-d) does not exist (!), then create it
if [[ ! -d ${DIR} ]]; then 
  mkdir ${DIR} && echo "${DIR} created" # if successful printout created
fi
# a becomes 1 then 2, and 3 and this is appended to the word foo_ to 
# create files in the directory that was created.
for a in 1 2 3 ; do
   touch ${DIR}/foo_$a
done

```

## Flags

- Using flags is a common way of passing input to a script. 

- When passing input to the script, thereâ€™s a flag (usually a single letter) starting with a hyphen (`-`) before each argument.

- The `getopts` function reads the flags in the input, and `OPTARG` refers to the corresponding values:

  <div style="font-size:24px">

  ```sh
  while getopts u:a:f: flag
  do
      case "${flag}" in
          u) username=${OPTARG};;
          a) age=${OPTARG};;
          f) fullname=${OPTARG};;
      esac
  done
  echo "Username: $username" echo "Age: $age" echo "Full Name: $fullname"
  ```

  </div>

---

## Shell Special Parameters

- `$!` is used to reference the PID of the most recently executed command in background.
- `$$` is used to reference the process ID of bash shell itself
- `$#` is quite a special bash parameter and it expands to a number of positional parameters in decimal.`
- `$0` bash parameter is used to reference the name of the shell or shell script.
- `$1` first supplied parameter, `$1...n`
- `$*` Expands to the the positional parameters starting from one. 
- `"$*"` Does the same thing but creates spaces between each argument

---

## Tasks 4.

<div style="font-size:24px">

```sh
#! /usr/bin/env bash

while getopts u:a:f: flag
do
    case "${flag}" in
        u) username=${OPTARG};;
        a) age=${OPTARG};;
        f) fullname=${OPTARG};;
    esac
done
echo "Username: $username" echo "Age: $age" echo "Full Name: $fullname"
```

`
$ ./parameters.sh -f 'Slim Shady' -a 25 -u Marshall
`

```sh
Username : Marshall
Age: 25
Full Name: Slim Shady
```

</div>

## Task 5: Reading from CLI

- Using the `stdin` stream by invocating `read` 

```sh
echo -n "Enter your name:"
read NAME
echo "Your name is:" ${NAME}

read -p "Enter your name: " NAME
echo Your name is ${NAME}.

read  -t  5 -p "Enter your password: "$'\n' -s PASSWORD
echo ${PASSWORD}

read -a WORDS <<< "Hello world!"
echo ${WORDS[0]}
echo ${WORDS[1]}
```

<!--
- p means prompt
- s means sensitive
- t timeout in seconds
- a array
-->
