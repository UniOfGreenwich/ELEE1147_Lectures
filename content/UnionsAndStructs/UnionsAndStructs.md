## What are Structs and Unions?

- **Structs:** Composite data types that group variables under a single name.
- **Unions:** Similar to structs but share the same memory space for all members.

---

## Structs

A struct is a user-defined data type in which different data types can be grouped together under a single name.

It is declared using the `struct` **keyword**, followed by the structure's name and a block of members enclosed in curly braces `{...}`.

<table align=center style="font-size:28px">
<tr>
<td>

```c
struct [NameOfStruct] {
    char var1;
    int var2;
    float var3;
};
```
</td>
<td>

$\Rightarrow$

</td>
<td>

```c
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float height;
};

```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

---

## Accessing Members

- **Accessing Members with Pointers**
  - For structs and unions, the arrow operator (`->)` is used when accessing members through pointers.

  ```c
  struct Person {
      char name[50];
      int age;
      float height;
  };

  struct Person person1;
  struct Person *personPointer = &person1;

  // Using the arrow operator
  personPointer->age = 25;

  // Equivalent longhand notation
  (*personPointer).age = 25;
  ```

--- 

## Arrays of Structs and Struct Members

- **Array of Structs**
  - You can create an array of structs to manage multiple records efficiently.

  ```c
  struct Student {
      char name[50];
      int age;
      float grades[5]; // Member is an array
  };

  int n = 20; // Number of students
  struct Student *class = (struct Student *)malloc(n * sizeof(struct Student));

  --- 

  class[0].age = 20;
  strcpy(class[0].name, "John Doe");
  class[0].grades[0] = 90.5;

  ```

--- 
## Unions
Definition:

```c
union Data {
    int intValue;
    float floatValue;
    char stringValue[20];
};
```

- Members share the same memory location.
- Size of union is the size of the largest member.

--- 

## Properties of Unions

- **Memory Sharing**
  - All members of a union share the same memory space.
  - Size of the union is determined by the largest member.

- **Single-Access at a Time**
  - Only one member of the union can be accessed at any given time.
  - Modifying one member affects the value of the others.

---

## Type Conversion with Unions

<div style="font-size:28px">

- **Memory Overlay:**

  - Unions store all their members at the same memory location.

  - This means that if you write a value to one member, you are essentially modifying the same memory that is used by other members.

- **Type Interpretation:**

  - When you access a member of the union, you interpret the stored bits according to the type of that member.

  - For example, if you write an integer to a union member and then access another member of type float, you interpret the same bits as a floating-point number.

</div>

---

## Example of Type Conversion

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">


<div style="font-size:26px">

- In this example, a float value (3.14) is stored in converter.floatValue.

- Then, by accessing converter.intValue, you interpret the same memory as an integer.

- This essentially converts the floating-point value to an integer.

</div>

<div>

```c
union TypeConverter {
    int intValue;
    float floatValue;
};

int main() {
    union TypeConverter converter;
    converter.floatValue = 3.14;
    int convertedInt = converter.intValue;
}
```

</div>

</div>

**Caution:**

- It's crucial to be cautious when using unions for type conversion to avoid undefined behavior or unexpected results.
